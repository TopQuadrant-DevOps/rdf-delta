/**
 * Supplies valid, connected {@link ZooKeeper} instances or throws an exception.
 *
 * {@link ZooKeeper} instances will attempt to reconnect on their own if the connection is lost. However, session
 * expiration causes an instance to become unusable. This class monitors connection state changes and will instantiate
 * a fresh {@link ZooKeeper} instance when a session expires. This class also monitors the Ensemble configuration and
 * will update the {@link #connectString} to reflect dynamic changes to the Ensemble.
 *
 * If all the Ensemble members present in the configuration leave the ensemble while the {@link ZooKeeper} instance
 * is invalid, new connection attempts will fail resulting in a {@link ZkException} that will crash the application.
 * This crash is essential to enabling the detection and replacement of a failed RDF Delta node.
 *
 * If {@link #close()} is called, calls to {@link #get()} will yield a {@link ZkException} that should crash the
 * system. Only call {@link #close()} when you are done with this {@link ValidZooKeeperSupplier}.
