# Delta : synchronized RDF Datasets

Delta is a system to keep copies of RDF Datasets up to date. The
copies can be close to each, such as in the same cluster of machines in
a datacentre, or geographically spread out.

Delta uses RDF Patch as a general purpose way to record changes to
an [RDF Dataset](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-dataset).

## RDF Patch {#rdf-patch}

This section is a brief outline of RDF Patch. 

See also:
* "[Introduction to RDF Patch](rdf-patch-intro.md)"
* "[RDF Patch Specification](rdf-patch.md)"

RDF Patch is a general purpose way to record changes to an [RDF
Dataset](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-dataset).
It provides a way to handle blank nodes so that datasets can keep the
system ids typically used for blank nodes in step.

This is an evolution of the original RDF Patch described in
"[RDF Patch â€“ Describing Changes to an RDF Dataset](https://afs.github.io/rdf-patch/)".

This new version is changed in the light of experience of using the
format. It is incompatible with the previous version.  The changes
simplify the design by remove unnecessary features, add support for
managing namespace prefixes and provide a header for the patch for
necessary metadata.

### Example

```
H id       <uuid:016f5292-2b49-11b2-80fe-6057182f557b> .
H previous <uuid:dd85b5f7-9965-42df-866c-d456bd1409de> .

## Delta {#delta}

Delta is for ...

Delta uses the patch format to provide a log of patches for an RDF
dataset. With the initial state of the dataset and the the lof
ofpatches, it is possible to create later versions of the dataset
because a log is sequence of patches in the order the chnages happened.

### Patch Log

The operations on a patch log are to be able to add a new patch to the
end of the log, or to read any patch or subsequence of patches.

In the example above, the patch header has an `id` and a `previous`.

The `id` is a globally unique identifier for this patch; it can also be
used to give a global version to the dataset that the patch creates.

The `previous` header field indicates which previous state of the
dataset this patch applies to.

Delta enforces the rule that to append to the log, the patch must
include in the previous field the id of the patch that this new patch
applies to.  If the wrong id is given or it is missing, the attempt to
append the patch is rejected. This stop two independent applications from
loggin a change to the same dataset version at the same time.  While
quite a strict way to guaranttee the order, for systems of only a few
machines, this simple mechanism is clearer, signals rejecting patches at
the earliest possible moment and means that the log can be reconstructed
just by reading the headers of each patch.

This means the log of sequence of patches with no branches.

This is only one way to use RDF Patch.  In other scenarios, a tree of
changes might be allowed, or other meta data might describe when the
patch should be applied; it may not be related to earlier patches and
can be used separately.  Delta is not trying to support all possible
uses of RDF Patch as a change record.

Delta also gives a numeric version number to each patch.  This makes it
easier to work with.  Version numbers are allocated when the patch
server stgarts up.  They may change over time, for example, oif a log is
consolidated into a shorter one.

### RSS and Atom

The nature of a patch log means it is suitable to publish changes using
RSS or Atom.  Systems across the web can then choose to update their
copy of a dataset.  More metadata about a match would need to be added
to the feed. but RDF Patch and the patch log can provide the building
blocks for publishing changes to a dataset.

Delta does not currently provide an RSS or Atom feed currently.

### Patch Server

A group of datasets is managed by one patch server.

#### Datasets

Each dataset being managed has a short name, a file name without a
path.  This name is only idenifying within the patch server.

Datsets are grouped into "zones" to reflect the need to have development,
staging and deployment systems for the same data.

#### Access

The patch log is managed by two URLs; one to POST request to append ot
the log, one to fetch patches using GET.  They can be the same or
different - having different URLs can make implementing security easier
in some situations dpending on the access control framework.




Patchs are sent to the server by POST:

    POST http://host/.../NAME/patch-log

and retrieved by

    GET http://host/.../NAME/patch-log?id=...

In addition there are operations to find out about the patch log:

| Operation | |
| --------- | ---- |
| List datasets and logs | |
| Describe a log | |
| REGISTER | | 
| ISREGISTERED | |
| LIST_DS | |
| DESCR_DS | |
| EPOCH | |
| DEREGISTER | |
| CREATE_DS | |
| REMOVE_DS  | |

These are provides as a simple JSON API to easy use from javascript applications.

See the [protocol description](delta-protocol.md).
